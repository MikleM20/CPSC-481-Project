### Current Project Ideas
#### InspireUs
Creators (artists, writers, composers, etc.) often struggle to come up with new ideas for their work. InspireUs would be a mobile app or website designed to generate simple prompts for creators to give them ideas. Users can set a schedule for how frequently they want to receive prompts and can keep track of how many prompts they have fulfilled, using a level system to track progress. Additionally, there would be a community aspect where people can share their work and see what other people have made using the same prompt. Different media, such as images, text, and audio, and links to existing creative social media, would be supported so a variety of creators could be engaged. There could also be an official prompt decided by the app that changes regularly, to encourage everyone to participate with that prompt.

### Stages
#### Stage 1
##### Goals
- Form a Team (team members above)  
- Create a Team Contract  
- [Online Repository](https://github.com/JacobHuber/CPSC481)  
- Project [Portfolio](https://miklem20.github.io/CPSC481-Project-Portfolio/)  
- Come Up With Three Idea Proposals  
###### Harmonic
Online social platform for people to share music(mobile app or website). Places an emphasis on sharing music with others by allowing them to listen to music simultaneously, and encouraging discussion about songs, genres, adn artists.

###### InspireUs
Mobile app or Website that generates and gives simple prompts to content creators to help them get their creative juices flowing. Allows for content creators to share their work regarding the prompt with others.

###### MyStamps
Mobile-accessible app for collecting stamps. Service providers can register with the app to add stamps for their service, while customers can record stamps they have with a scanning function to help keep the organized and easily accessible.

#### Stage 2
##### Goals
- Identify Project Idea - InspireUs  
- Figure out who is impacted (in one way or another) by this system -- these are stakeholders.  
- Create a list of stakeholders and users, and describe them (particularly the users) in terms of how much training/experience they might have, their background knowledge, etc.  
- Conduct two user research methods.
