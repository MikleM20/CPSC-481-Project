## Fall 2019 CPSC 481- Human Computer Interaction Project

Welcome to our team's portfolio page for our CPSC 481 project. This page will be updated throughout the project and will describe the progress of our project.

Creators (artists, writers, composers, etc.) often struggle to come up with new ideas for their work. InspireUs would be a mobile app or website designed to generate simple prompts for creators to give them ideas. Users can set a schedule for how frequently they want to receive prompts and can keep track of how many prompts they have fulfilled, using a level system to track progress. Additionally, there would be a community aspect where people can share their work and see what other people have made using the same prompt. Different media, such as images, text, and audio, and links to existing creative social media, would be supported so a variety of creators could be engaged. There could also be an official prompt decided by the app that changes regularly, to encourage everyone to participate with that prompt.

### Stages
#### Stage 1
##### Goals
- Form a Team (team members above)  
- Create a [Team Contract](https://miklem20.github.io/CPSC481-Project-Portfolio/pdfs/Team%2021%20Team%20Contract.pdf)  
- [Online Repository](https://github.com/JacobHuber/CPSC481)
- [Project Portfolio](https://miklem20.github.io/CPSC481-Project-Portfolio/)  
- Come Up With [Three Idea Proposals](https://miklem20.github.io/CPSC481-Project-Portfolio/pdfs/Team%2021%20Project%20Proposals.pdf)  

#### Stage 2
##### Goals
- Identify Main Project Idea - InspireUs  
- Create a list of stakeholders and users, and describe them (particularly the users) in terms of how much training/experience they might have, their background knowledge, etc.  
- Conduct two user research methods

##### Research Methods
We chose to make use of interviews and personas as we felt it would help us gain some knowledge regarding what stakeholders want, while at the same time would push us towards putting ourselves into their shoes so that we can gain new perspectives which will help us grow our idea.  
  
- Interviews  
  - [Questionaire used Throughout Interviews](https://miklem20.github.io/CPSC481-Project-Portfolio/pdfs/questions.pdf)  
  - [Compilation of Interview Results](https://miklem20.github.io/CPSC481-Project-Portfolio/pdfs/interviews.pdf)  

- Personas  
  - [Mark - Art Professor](https://miklem20.github.io/CPSC481-Project-Portfolio/pdfs/Mark%20Persona.pdf)
  - [Abigail - Professional Artist](https://miklem20.github.io/CPSC481-Project-Portfolio/pdfs/Abigail%20Persona.pdf)

#### Stage 3

**Ideation**

![alt text](https://github.com/JacobHuber/CPSC481/blob/Stage3/Sketches/Sketch%20Summary.jpg?raw=true "Sketches")

In this stage, we brainstormed ideas for the InspireUs interface by sketching. After discussing our sketches, we listed the key ideas from each in an affinity diagramming session.

We constructed a storyboard illustrating several core tasks of our system.

From this storyboard, we developed a [low-fidelity Powerpoint prototype](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t32hmLbLJoU&feature=youtu.be), which is showcased in the linked video.

This prototype was used to perform a task-centered design walkthrough. We identified areas for improvement, such as adding more options for viewing posts, more flexible post editing, and more streamlined shopping and profile customization.
