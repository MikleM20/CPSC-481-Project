## Fall 2019 CPSC 481- Human Computer Interaction Project

Welcome to our team's portfolio page for our CPSC 481 project. This page will be updated throughout the project and will describe the progress of our project.

### InspireUs
Creators (artists, writers, composers, etc.) often struggle to come up with new ideas for their work. InspireUs would be a mobile app or website designed to generate simple prompts for creators to give them ideas. Users can set a schedule for how frequently they want to receive prompts and can keep track of how many prompts they have fulfilled, using a level system to track progress. Additionally, there would be a community aspect where people can share their work and see what other people have made using the same prompt. Different media, such as images, text, and audio, and links to existing creative social media, would be supported so a variety of creators could be engaged. There could also be an official prompt decided by the app that changes regularly, to encourage everyone to participate with that prompt.

#### Stage 2
##### Goals
- Identify Main Project Idea - InspireUs  
- Create a list of stakeholders and users, and describe them (particularly the users) in terms of how much training/experience they might have, their background knowledge, etc.  
- Conduct two user research methods

###### Research Methods
[Interviews](https://github.com/JacobHuber/CPSC481/tree/Stage2/Interviews) and [Personas](https://github.com/JacobHuber/CPSC481/tree/Stage2/Personas)  
We chose to make use of interviews and personas as we felt it would help us gain some knowledge regarding what stakeholders want, while at the same time would push us towards putting ourselves into their shoes so that we can gain new perspectives which will help us grow our idea.
